Idea :

The idea is to create a vest or a jacket in which LEDs will be embedded so that countries where traffic is manually controlled by traffic police or traffic guards, they can wear it and the LEDs will be programmed with the timings like that of a traffic light so that less human error will occur and goverment can easily buy these vests/jackets in cost effective prices rather go for traffic light posts which will cost a lot of money for remote areas.
